I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Brain Research. I study how cells choose their fates during early development, focusing on transcriptional noise and micro-heterogeneity. Working with human iPSCs in micropattern systems, I track single-cell transcriptional trajectories to understand how stochastic fluctuations lead to stable identities.

My earlier projects have ranged from biomineralisation enzymes to the non-canonical roles of the peripheral nervous system and the evolutionary diversification of cell types. Along the way, I have worked with plants, zebrafish, mice, and even the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis.
As a side project, I am developing heavy-metal chelation strategies that enhance soft-tissue contrast in micro-CT, with the potential to achieve sub-cellular resolution for developmental and anatomical studies.
