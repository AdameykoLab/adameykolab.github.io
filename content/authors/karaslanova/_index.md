I am a PhD student specializing in **single-cell RNA sequencing** (scRNA-seq) and **spatial transcriptomics** (ST), with a focus on vertebrate development and regeneration. I graduated from Moscow State University, Department of Biology, with a major in embryology.

One of my research projects aims to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving tissue regeneration using scRNA-seq. I focus on exploring and comparing the differentiation and dedifferentiation pathways that cells undergo during **regeneration and development**. By studying these pathways across various vertebrate models, I seek to identify key molecular differences between regenerative and developmental responses, ultimately advancing our understanding of regenerative biology.

Additionally, I am applying spatial transcriptomics to investigate clonal relationships in development. By mapping gene expression together with lineage tracing within intact tissues at single-cell resolution, I aim to trace cell lineage dynamics and uncover spatially regulated molecular programs that guide tissue formation.

Outside my main research, I have a hobby project in a completely different field — I enjoy studying coral skeleton formation using advanced imaging techniques, particularly micro-computed tomography (µCT).
