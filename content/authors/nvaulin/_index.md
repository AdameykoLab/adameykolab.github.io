Hi! I am bioinformatician interested in cell fate decisions, especially in the context of neurodevelopment I think (I hope) we are now on the cusp of putting together a complete picture of how the various processes together govern the life of a cell.

Transcription factors, chromatin structure, post-translational modifications, etc. - they set the rules of the game in which the cell must go from the opening through the mittelspiel to the endgame. Chaos plays its role, but I believe that by defining a fully-omics state space we can anticipate all possible outcomes.
