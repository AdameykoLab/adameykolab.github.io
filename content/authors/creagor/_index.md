My research focuses on understanding how dynamic gene regulatory networks control cells’ fate decisions during tissue development and regeneration. This work integrates machine learning and single-cell transcriptomics with lineage tracing and genetic perturbations to dissect biologically relevant sub-networks across embryonic tissues and stem cells. I am also interested in bridging computational predictions with experimental validations to relate cells’ distinct phenotypes with underlying mechanisms of gene regulation.
