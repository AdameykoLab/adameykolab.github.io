I'm a bioinformatics scientist doing my PhD at the Adameyko lab. I graduated from the Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics of Moscow State University and also have industrial experience working at BostonGene company. My previous experience was related to the analysis of scRNA-Seq datasets of different lymphomas to get insights into their microenvironment and tissue architecture.

My PhD research here is aimed to understand key features of neural crest cells’ fate decisions during embryogenesis based on lineage tracing data from different developmental time points and with different genetic perturbations.
