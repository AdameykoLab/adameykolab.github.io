My projects focus on unraveling cell multipotency and their potential acquisition of the disease or pre-malignant state. I use the early neural crest and sympathoadrenal lineages as a model system to understand what changes during the development influence cell potential to develop neurocristopathies.  I apply lineage tracing, single-cell multi-omics, stem cell cultures, and organoids to study cell fate decisions in health and disease states
