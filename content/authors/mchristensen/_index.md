I am a postdoctoral researcher focused on the role of gene regulatory elements in embryonic development and morphological evolution. My projects specifically investigate the development of neural crest-derived structures, with an emphasis on craniofacial features. Using techniques such as CUT&RUN and Hi-C, I aim to identify and characterize gene regulatory regions that guide neural crest cell fate decisions and contribute to phenotypic variation both within and among vertebrate species.
