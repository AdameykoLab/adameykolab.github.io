I'm bioinformatics PhD student at Adameyko lab. 2023 I graduated from Uppsala University with a Master of Science in Engineering with specialization in biotechnology and bioinformatics. Before joining Adameyko lab I also worked a year as a research assistant at KI with bioinformatics. My work has mainly been in spatial transcriptomics, scATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq in different context. 

My PhD will be focused on integrating single cell clonal, spatial and dissociated cell transcriptomics data for 3D neurodevelopmental reconstruction.
