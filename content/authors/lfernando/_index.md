I got my Bachelor's in Genomic Sciences at UNAM, Mexico. Then I did my Masters and PhD in Cell (quantitative) biology at the University of Edinburgh. Recently I finished a Postdoc at St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI, Vienna) working on single-cell transcriptomics of the differentiating trunk neural crest in the presence of cancer mutations. **My interests** come in two flavours: 

+ Can we understand mechanistically how cells integrate multiple inputs into a phenotypic decision (among many choices like in the neural crest)? 

+ Can we figure out what drives response heterogeneity across individuals in a population?  

Beside science I love food, games, creativity, learning, and music.
